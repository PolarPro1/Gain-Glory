      <h3>Planning</h3>
      <p>The planning stage is crucial for successful meal prepping. Start by deciding on the meals you want to prepare for the week or a few days in advance. This could include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. Consider the number of people you will be cooking for, any dietary restrictions or preferences, and the time you have available to prepare the meals. Once you have your meal plan, create a shopping list for the ingredients you will need.</p>

      <p>The prepping stage involves washing and chopping vegetables, marinating meats, and cooking grains or legumes. It is helpful to use kitchen tools like a food processor, blender, or slow cooker to save time and energy. Try to multitask by preparing multiple dishes at once, such as roasting vegetables while cooking rice.</p>
      <h3>Portioning</h3>
      <p>Once the meals are prepared, it is time to portion them out into containers. This helps with portion control and makes it easy to grab a meal on-the-go. Use meal prep containers or simply store the meals in airtight containers. Measure out the appropriate amount of each dish and label the containers with the date and contents.</p>
      <h3>Storage</h3>

      <p>Proper storage is crucial to ensure the meals stay fresh and safe to eat. It is recommended to refrigerate meals for up to four days or freeze them for longer storage. Make sure to cool the meals to room temperature before storing them in the fridge or freezer. If freezing, leave some space at the top of the container to allow for expansion.</p>
      <h3>Reheating</h3>
      <p>When it's time to eat, simply reheat the meals in the microwave, oven, or stovetop. Make sure to follow food safety guidelines when reheating, such as heating the food to an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Enjoy your freshly prepared meals!</p>
